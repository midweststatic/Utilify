# Utilify (Rewrite)

A modern, modular, and enhanced userscript designed for the KoGaMa platform.

***

## 🛑 Safety & Compliance Notice

Utilify is a third-party extension. Users are solely responsible for its use and should adhere strictly to the platform's rules.

### Official KoGaMa Developer Guidelines

The following message was provided by the KoGaMa lead web developer regarding extensions:

> "Hello. Tokeeto here. I'm the lead web developer at KoGaMa. I'm not entirely sure what a 'Vencord like extension' would entail, but you're very welcome to create any extension, as long as:
> 1. **It doesn't violate the privacy of other users.**
> 2. **You are responsible with your use of our APIs** (Do not spam-poll them, cache where sensible, etc.).
> 3. **It doesn't interfere with the game client at all.**
> Best of luck!"

### Feature Risk Assessment

The table below outlines features within the script that may violate the above guidelines, potentially leading to account consequences. **Use features marked as HIGH Risk with extreme caution.**

| Feature | Violation Type & Rationale | Risk Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Friend Activity Stalking** | **Unresponsible API Use (Spam-Polling)**. The script polls the `/friend/chat/` API endpoint every **5 seconds (5000ms)**. This aggressive, frequent polling is a violation of the "Do not spam-poll them" rule. | **HIGH** |
| **Appear Offline** | **Interference with the Game Client**. The feature actively intercepts and blocks network requests (pulse/status updates) intended by the official client, directly preventing it from communicating its intended status to the server. | **HIGH** |
| **Player Analytics** | **Unresponsible API Use (Efficiency)**. The module polls the entire game page HTML every 15 seconds to extract only two numbers. This inefficient resource usage (downloading and parsing large documents repeatedly) may violate the "cache where sensible" guideline. | **MEDIUM** |

**Note:** This is an early alpha version. Expect missing features and placeholder modules as the rewrite progresses.

# **Categorized Feature Overview**

Below is a refined and structured overview of all features, grouped into coherent categories while retaining the `feat : def` form. The formatting is intentionally clean, readable, and not overly ornate.

## 🛠️ Installation Guide

Utilify is a userscript and requires a userscript manager to run in your browser.

### Step 1: Install a Userscript Manager
You must first install a browser extension that can manage and run userscripts.

* **For Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera:** Install **Tampermonkey**.
    * [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
    * [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)

### Step 2: Install Utilify
Once your userscript manager is installed, click the installation link below. Tampermonkey will automatically recognize the file and prompt you to install it.

1.  Click the installation link:
    👉 [Install Utilify (Rewrite)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7v6a/Utilify/refs/heads/main/Script/Rewrite/Utilify.user.js)
2.  Review the script's code/metadata in the Tampermonkey editor window.
3.  Click the **Install** button to finalize the installation.

### Step 3: Verify and Use
The script will activate the next time you load or refresh any KoGaMa page (`*://www.kogama.com/*`). Look for the custom configuration panel to access and manage the features.
